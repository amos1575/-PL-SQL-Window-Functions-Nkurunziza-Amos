# -PL-SQL-Window-Functions-Nkurunziza-Amos
PL/SQL Window Functions project: analyzing supermarket sales, customer behavior, and growth trends using SQL analytics


*1. Problem Definition*

*Business Context*
A supermarket chain in Kigali with multiple branches across Rwanda sells groceries, beverages, and household products.

*Data Challenge*
Management needs insights into sales performance across regions, customer purchase behavior, and growth trends. They want to know the top products per region, track month-to-month growth, and segment customers based on spending.

*Expected Outcome*

Identify top-selling products per region/quarter.

Track running monthly sales totals.

Calculate month-over-month growth.

Segment customers into quartiles.

Compute 3-month moving averages for trend analysis.

*2. Success Criteria*

This project delivers 5 measurable goals:

Top 5 products per region/quarter â†’ RANK()

Running monthly sales totals â†’ SUM() OVER()

Month-over-month growth â†’ LAG() / LEAD()

Customer quartiles â†’ NTILE(4)

3-month moving averages â†’ AVG() OVER()

*3. Database Schema*
Tables

customers

customer_id (PK), name, region

products

product_id (PK), name, category

transactions

transaction_id (PK), customer_id (FK), product_id (FK), sale_date, amount

*Ranking â€“ Top 5 Products per Region/Quarter*



SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT region,
           product_id,
           TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Q') AS quarter,
           SUM(amount) AS total_sales,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region, TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Q') 
                        ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC) AS sales_rank
    FROM customers c
    JOIN transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
    GROUP BY region, product_id, TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Q')
) ranked_sales
WHERE sales_rank <= 5;

Insight: Shows the top 5 best-selling products in each region per quarter.

*Aggregate â€“ Running Monthly Sales Totals*


SELECT TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       SUM(amount) AS monthly_sales,
       SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')) AS running_total
FROM transactions
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month;

Insight: Tracks how sales accumulate month by month.

*Navigation â€“ Month-over-Month Growth*


SELECT TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       SUM(amount) AS monthly_sales,
       LAG(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')) AS prev_month,
       ( (SUM(amount) - LAG(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM'))) 
          / LAG(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')) ) * 100 
          AS growth_percent
FROM transactions
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month;

Insight: Calculates growth percentage compared to the previous month.

*Distribution â€“ Customer Quartiles*


SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC) AS quartile
FROM transactions
GROUP BY customer_id;


<img width="1005" height="501" alt="DISTRIBUTION" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d01cf6fc-0329-47cf-a7c3-22f06033b2bf" />

Insight: Segments customers into quartiles (top spenders, high-mid, low-mid, lowest).

*Moving Averages â€“ 3-Month Average*


SELECT TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       SUM(amount) AS monthly_sales,
       AVG(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') 
                              ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg_3m
FROM transactions
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month;

Insight: Smooths sales trends using a 3-month moving average.
